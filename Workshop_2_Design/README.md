## How the analysis was carried out?

First, we carefully studied the main problem to understand exactly what we needed to analyze. We identified all the important terms and system behaviors related to tracking player contacts. This helped us create a first diagram that served as our visual guide throughout the project.

Next, we examined how the system would be used in real situations. This helped us separate what was truly important from what wasn't necessary. We defined the system's key components and how they would work together, removing any elements that our team discussions and feedback showed were either repeating other functions or beyond our project's scope.

A very important step was finding the system's weak points and places where errors or problems might occur. We marked these as areas that would need special attention later. To work more efficiently, we divided the documentation work among team members based on each person's strengths, giving everyone the sections they could handle best.

Finally, we did group review sessions to make sure we all used the same technical terms, fix any mistakes, and check that everything in our analysis made sense together. This team approach helped us create complete documentation that not only explained how the contact tracking system would work, but also predicted where challenges might appear.
