# Kaggle Player Contact Detection - Catch-Up Summary

## Project Overview

This repository documents the progress and analysis of our system designed for detecting player contacts in NFL games. The work integrates data from the Kaggle competition on player contact detection, employing video and sensor data to improve accuracy and reliability in contact identification.

Our primary focus was on developing a CPU-efficient, modular system leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning and computer vision techniques. The solution prioritizes scalability and adaptability to real-game conditions while addressing hardware constraints and data challenges.
